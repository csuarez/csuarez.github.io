      <description>This article presents an overview of the ALOE platform. ALOE provides a service-oriented architecture aimed at the research in the early detection of breast cancer diagnosis. The development of the ALOE platform is carried out by collaboration among CETA-CIEMAT, INEGI, FMUP-HSJ and UA. ALOE supports two research lines in breast cancer diagnosis: the development of well performing computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems and the development of new tools-based on e-learning techniques to improve radiologists training.</description>

      <description>Machine learning and imaging analytics are major algorithmic components of the software used by medical practitioners in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Whether employed by computer aided diagnosis (CADx) or content-based image retrieval (CBIR) tools, the accuracy and relevance of the results to the practitioner are paramount to the success of any such application. In order to improve on the existing results researchers often find themselves in the need to explore various approaches and methodologies, often using very large datasets and multiple sources of information.</description>

      <description>Breast cancer is one of the most diagnosed types of cancer. Early detection of breast cancer is the best practice to reduce its high mortality rate. Double reading is a common practice to avoid missed cancer cases during the lecture of mammograms. Due to the high cost of this technique and the lack of certified radiologists, computer-aided diagnosis systems have become very popular in the last decade. However, this technique is not perfect, and has some significant disadvantages, like higher recall rates.</description>

      <description>Breast cancer is one of the cancer type most diagnosed. Its causes are unknown so there is not an effective way to prevent it, which increases the mortality rate. The early detection of breast cancer is the best practice to reduce this rate. The double reading of mammograms is a common practice to reduce the rate of missed cancer, but it has a high cost. Computer Aided-diagnosis (CADx) Systems and Machine Learning Classifiers (MLCs) help to reduce this cost making automatic the second read of the mammograms.</description>

      <title>Clarabox: A platform to manage easily Grid storage</title>
      <link>http://csuarez.me/publication/clarabox-gisela/</link>

      <description>The Grid [1] is a useful technology for sharing computational and storage resources between centers to speed up their research activities. It is a mature technology, widely used by the scientific community, but sometimes its use can be complex for final users. The main problem is that typical Grid front-ends are command line interfaces (CLI) which implies that final users have to memorize complex commands in order to start using the Grid services.</description>

      <description>Nowadays, Science Gateways are a trending topic in the Grid community. This kind of web portals allows sending jobs to a Grid infrastructure through a single process. Science Gateway users can configure the vast majority of the parameters Command Line Interface (CLI) may need. This way, it is possible to specify job input and output files, monitor the status of a job and download its output when finished.
Science Gateways are a good tool for accessing distributed resources, not only Grid resources, but also other paradigms, since Science Gateways are considered as an universal interface to many kinds of distributed computing resources.</description>

      <description>This paper describes the main results of the IMED Project. The IMED project is collaboration among CETA-CIEMAT in Spain, the Faculty of Engineering (FEUP) and the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Porto (FMUP) and Hospital Sao Joao in Porto (HSJ), Portugal, devoted to the research of computer-based detection and diagnosis methods of breast cancer.
The project activities can be separated in two main task groups: 1) data gathering and dataset building and 2) designing and modelling of Machine Learning Classifiers (MLC).</description>

      <title>gridCake &amp; gridCamp: Making the Grid easier</title>

      <description>The Grid has shown to be a valuable technology for researchers. However, its frontends are usually designed for users with high computational skills and they aren&amp;rsquo;t very user-friendly. This fact typically causes contempt to final users, because they want to focus their efforts on their researches, skipping concepts not related with their studies. Also, the tools to make software that can interact with Grid services are complex, generally poorly documented and sometimes they don&amp;rsquo;t support latest Grid middleware versions.</description>

      <title>Discovering Mammography-based Machine Learning Classifiers for Breast Cancer Diagnosis</title>
      <link>http://csuarez.me/publication/discovering-journal-medical-systems/</link>

      <description>This work explores the design of mammography-based machine learning classifiers (MLC) and proposes a new method to build MLC for breast cancer diagnosis. We massively evaluated MLC configurations to classify features vectors extracted from segmented regions (pathological lesion or normal tissue) on craniocaudal (CC) and/or mediolateral oblique (MLO) mammography image views, providing BI-RADS diagnosis. Previously, appropriate combinations of image processing and normalization techniques were applied to reduce image artifacts and increase mammograms details.</description>

      <description>The present paper describes the development of the CardioGrid framework into the Grid infrastructure. The core Grid services; workload management system (WMS), data management system and grid authentication have been implemented. Additionally, a Web-based tool -the CardioGrid portal-has been developed to facilitate the user interaction with the Grid. As a result, the user is able to process the electrocardiogram (ECG) signals obtained form a portable data acquisition device and to process them on the Grid.</description>
